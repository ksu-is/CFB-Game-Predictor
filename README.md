Machine learning that predicts the outcome of any Division I college football game. Data are from 2015 - 2024 seasons. My DNN has an accuracy of 84% on the validation data. The model will use multi-class learning to use the prior week's feature data to predict next week's feature data. Multiple models were used to achieve this. Data are from SportsReference and CFBD.
